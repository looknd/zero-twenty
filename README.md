## Introduction

Twenty is a blog system based on [zerojs](http://github.com/sskyy/zero). While some features were inspired by Ghost, there are also many beyond Ghost like:

 - Module system. Inherit form zero, easy to extend.
 - Angular based admin panel and standard RESTful api. No pain to customize.
 - Multiple page engine supported. Jade or Ejs, you can even use both at same time.

 
## Quick start

Less than five minute.


```
npm install zero -g
zero new blog
cd blog
zero install twenty

...waiting for twenty install...

cp modules/twenty/config.sample.js modules/twenty/config.js

node app
```

## Next

A complete develop guide will be released soon.
